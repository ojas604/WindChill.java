Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows:
w = 35.74 + 0.6215 T + (0.4275 T – 35.75) v^0.16
Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill.
